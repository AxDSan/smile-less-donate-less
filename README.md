Smile More, Donate More :)
======

**Smile More, Donate More :)** is a lightweight Chrome extension built in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. While browsing on Chrome, the extension captures any Amazon.com URL requests entered by the user and sends the browser to AmazonSmile (https://smile.amazon.com) instead. AmazonSmile is Amazon's charity program for non-profit organizations. For every purchase through AmazonSmile, Amazon donates 0.5% of the price of eligible items to the user's charity organization of choice.
