Smile More, Donate More :)
======

**Smile More, Donate More :)** is a lightweight browser extension built in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The extension captures any Amazon.com URL requests browsed to by the user and instead sends the browser to the AmazonSmile (https://smile.amazon.com) mirror page. AmazonSmile is Amazon's charity program for non-profit organizations. For every purchase through AmazonSmile, Amazon donates 0.5% of the price of eligible items to the user's charity organization of choice.
